    connect: reject paths that look like command line options
    
    If we get a repo path like "-repo.git", we may try to invoke
    "git-upload-pack -repo.git". This is going to fail, since
    upload-pack will interpret it as a set of bogus options. But
    let's reject this before we even run the sub-program, since
    we would not want to allow any mischief with repo names that
    actually are real command-line options.
    
    You can still ask for such a path via git-daemon, but there's no
    security problem there, because git-daemon enters the repo itself
    and then passes "."  on the command line.

Author: Jeff King <peff@peff.net>

    connect: reject dashed arguments for proxy commands
    
    If you have a GIT_PROXY_COMMAND configured, we will run it
    with the host/port on the command-line. If a URL contains a
    mischievous host like "--foo", we don't know how the proxy
    command may handle it. It's likely to break, but it may also
    do something dangerous and unwanted (technically it could
    even do something useful, but that seems unlikely).
    
    We should err on the side of caution and reject this before
    we even run the command.
    
    The hostname check matches the one we do in a similar
    circumstance for ssh. The port check is not present for ssh,
    but there it's not necessary because the syntax is "-p
    <port>", and there's no ambiguity on the parsing side.
    
    It's not clear whether you can actually get a negative port
    to the proxy here or not. Doing:
    
      git fetch git://remote:-1234/repo.git
    
    keeps the "-1234" as part of the hostname, with the default
    port of 9418. But it's a good idea to keep this check close
    to the point of running the command to make it clear that
    there's no way to circumvent it (and at worst it serves as a
    belt-and-suspenders check).

    connect: factor out "looks like command line option" check
    
    We reject hostnames that start with a dash because they may
    be confused for command-line options. Let's factor out that
    notion into a helper function, as we'll use it in more
    places. And while it's simple now, it's not clear if some
    systems might need more complex logic to handle all cases.

Date:   Wed Jul 26 10:24:20 2017 -0700

    connect: reject ssh hostname that begins with a dash
    
    When commands like "git fetch" talk with ssh://$rest_of_URL/, the
    code splits $rest_of_URL into components like host, port, etc., and
    then spawns the underlying "ssh" program by formulating argv[] array
    that has:
    
     - the path to ssh command taken from GIT_SSH_COMMAND, etc.
    
     - dashed options like '-batch' (for Tortoise), '-p <port>' as
       needed.
    
     - ssh_host, which is supposed to be the hostname parsed out of
       $rest_of_URL.
    
     - then the command to be run on the other side, e.g. git
       upload-pack.
    
    If the ssh_host ends up getting '-<anything>', the argv[] that is
    used to spawn the command becomes something like:
    
        { "ssh", "-p", "22", "-<anything>", "command", "to", "run", NULL }
    
    which obviously is bogus, but depending on the actual value of
    "<anything>", will make "ssh" parse and use it as an option.
    
    Prevent this by forbidding ssh_host that begins with a "-".

+Git v2.7.6 Release Notes
+========================
+
+Fixes since v2.7.5
+------------------
+
+ * A "ssh://..." URL can result in a "ssh" command line with a
+   hostname that begins with a dash "-", which would cause the "ssh"
+   command to instead (mis)treat it as an option.  This is now
+   prevented by forbidding such a hostname (which will not be
+   necessary in the real world).
+
+ * Similarly, when GIT_PROXY_COMMAND is configured, the command is
+   run with host and port that are parsed out from "ssh://..." URL;
+   a poorly written GIT_PROXY_COMMAND could be tricked into treating
+   a string that begins with a dash "-".  This is now prevented by
+   forbidding such a hostname and port number (again, which will not
+   be necessary in the real world).
+
+ * In the same spirit, a repository name that begins with a dash "-"
+   is also forbidden now.
+
+Credits go to Brian Neel at GitLab, Joern Schneeweisz of Recurity
+Labs and Jeff King at GitHub.
